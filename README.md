# LOTJ-BlindTools
A page containing all files and instructions to make Mush client usable for people with screen readers.

Hey all
How are you today?
Hope all is well.
Today we will talk about how to let mush work with screen readers.
So how to let this thing work with blind people?
Most of the files are pluggins which would be installed using the pluggin wizzard, alt, then go to files menu, then pluggins, then press add  and brows for the file.
The 2 files which we need to add in mush directry are nvda.dll and nvda controler client 32.dll.
You can make your own sounds and triggers but I can't explain this that much here.
My explaining will be so limitted and might not assist you that much in  achieving your dreams.
If you need help, just shout at me on Discord or on the OOC channel, maybe tells too, but I don't guarantee  answering OOC channel all the time, depends on when.

Please read output functions pluggin guide to know how to copy colors in Legends of the Jedi and how to use the pluggin to its fullest extend.
Regards
  Mohammed Radwan
