# LOTJ-BlindTools
A page containing all files and instructions to make Mush client usable for people with screen readers.

hey all
how are you today?
hope all is well.
today we will talk about how to let mush work with screen readers.
so how to let this thing work with blind people
most of the files are pluggins which would be installed using the pluggin wizzard, alt, then go to files menu, then pluggins, then press add  and brows for the file.
the 2 files which we need to add in mush directry are nvda.dll and nvda controler client 32.dll
you can make your own sounds and triggers but i can't explain this that much here
my explaining will be so limitted and might not assist you that much in  achieving your dreams.
